1. Exploring the dataset:
   This is a crucial first step. You'll want to look at basic statistics, data types, missing values, and get a general sense of your data.

2. Converting Categorical values to Numerical:
   This is necessary for most machine learning algorithms. Common techniques include one-hot encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding depending on the nature of your categorical variables.

3. Plotting Heatmap to see dependency of Dependent value on Independent features:
   A correlation heatmap is an excellent way to visualize relationships between variables. It can help identify potential multicollinearity issues.

4. Data Visualization (Plots of feature vs feature):
   This step helps you understand relationships between different features. Scatter plots, pair plots, and box plots can be particularly useful here.

5. Plotting Skew and Kurtosis:
   This will help you understand the distribution of your variables. Highly skewed data might benefit from transformation.

6. Data Preparation:
   This likely involves steps like handling missing values, feature scaling, and possibly feature engineering.

7-10. Prediction using various models:
    You're using a good mix of algorithms here: Linear Regression, SVR (Support Vector Regression), Ridge Regression, and Random Forest Regressor. Each has its strengths and assumptions.

11. Performing Hyper tuning for above mentioned models:
    This is crucial for optimizing model performance. Techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization can be used.

12. Plotting Graph for all Models to compare performance:
    This final step will help you visually compare the performance of different models. Consider using metrics like MSE, RMSE, or R-squared for regression tasks.

This is a solid workflow that covers the key steps in a data science project. Remember to also consider:

- Cross-validation to ensure your models generalize well
- Feature importance analysis, especially for the Random Forest model
- Residual analysis for the regression models
- Possibly trying more advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
